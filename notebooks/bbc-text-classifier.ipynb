Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said. The call was made in a report into the BBCs Freeview digital service. \"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money,\" said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh. \"The BBCs spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament. \"Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over xc2xa32 billion a year, is used.\"  A BBC spokeswoman said: \"We share the committees interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well.

The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.  The report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date. The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen. There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably.

The introduction of chip and pin cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street. But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.  The introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature.

Retail Decisions survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best. \"The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,\" said Mr Clump. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. Of these, 83% were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary chip technology from all their card providers. Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had.

This is not possible, at least with my version of the `transformers` library (3.5.1). The reason for this is that the `SummarizationPipeline` uses Facebook's BART model, whose maximal input length is 1024 tokens. However, `transformers`'s tokenizers, including `BartTokenizer`, do not automatically truncate sequences to the max input length of the corresponding model. As a consequence, the `SummarizationPipeline` crashes whenever sequences longer than 1024 tokens are given as inputs. Since there are quite a few long articles in the BBC dataset, we will have to make a custom summarization pipeline that truncates news longers than 1024 tokens."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":98,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-13T20:26:00.587459Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-13T20:26:00.586802Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-13T20:26:09.352240Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-13T20:26:09.351225Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-13T20:26:00.587426Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"82aa4dce68fa484fbae5d20916813772","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["config.json:

The raw Zero-Shot Classification pipeline from the `transformers` library could not compete at all with such a performance, ending up with a ~59% accuracy on the same test set. Nonetheless, this result is still decent considering the complete absence of training required by this method.  \n","  \n","Given the substantial length of the BBC News articles, we tried summarizing them before performing the Zero-Shot classification, still using the beloved `transformers` library.
